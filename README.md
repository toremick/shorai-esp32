# shorai-esp32
This will work for Toshiba Shorai, Seiya and Kazumi

This works great for me, but is at your own risk!

Hit me up on (https://discord.gg/wYYFawvqfr) if there is anything
i can help with


## Software install
* Download firmware here: https://github.com/toremick/shorai-esp32/blob/main/firmware/firmware.bin
* Install esptool.py on your pc. (https://cyberblogspot.com/how-to-install-esptool-on-windows-10/)  
* put firmware.bin i c:\  
* open command prompt and run following from c:\  (edit COM3 to reflect your serial port number)   
 * `esptool.py --chip esp32 --port COM3 --baud 460800 write_flash -z 0x1000 firmware.bin`

* When installed, you need to use thonny (www.thonny.org) or similiar to connect to the esp32.  
* at the repl run the following commands:  
 `import installation`  
 `installation.install_now('YOUR-SSID', 'YOUR-WIFI-PASSWD')`  
* this will install the files needed on your esp32 in /main folder
* Refresh the file content  
![Refresh thonny](images/refresh-thonny.png?raw=true "Refresh thonny")  
* edit config.py to set up your network etc.

### PCB Layout
![PCB layout](images/pcb.PNG?raw=true "PCB layout")
U5 is a jumper, close the jumper to be powered from the heatpump. Remove jumper when powered from usb.

R1: 220R  
R2: 470R  
R3: 10K  
R7,R8,R9,R10: 1K  
U1,U2: 817A (Optocouplers)  
C1: 100uF  
U5: When connected with a Jumper, the pcb is powered from the AC (can be soldered)

### Home assistant Climate config part

**Important note:**
If you have more than one device, please remember to change the *name*, *unique_id* and all the mqtt strings to have unique names. For each device replace the heatpump name with the unique 'maintopic' you have configured in the config.py of your ESP32 device. 

```
mqtt:
  climate:
    - name: HeatPump
      icon: mdi:air-conditioner
      unique_id: toshibaheatpump
      modes:
        - "off"
        - "auto"
        - "cool"

        - "fan_only"
      swing_modes:

      swing_mode_state_topic: "heatpump/swingmode/state"
      temp_step: 1

```


### Add following to automations.yaml or where you have your automations
(this will query the heatpump for all values so HA will have current state
for everything)

``` 
- id: gethpvalues_on_startup 
  alias: "HP states on HA start-up" 
  trigger:
    platform: homeassistant
    event: start
  action: 
  - service: mqtt.publish 
    data: 
      topic: heatpump/doinit
      payload: startup-ha
    
```
